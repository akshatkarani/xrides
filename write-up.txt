Back-end Task

1. Understanding of the problem

To create a API using which user can pass a csv file and 
the data in that file is saved into PostgreSQL database.

2. Implementation

The API provides one function `send_data` which accepts 
path to csv file as a argument and returns True if data was
successfully entered into the database.

Data is entered in database named `xride` and table named `xride_data`.
I have assumed that table is already created and information schema of the
table is:

    column_name       | data_type 
----------------------+-----------
 id                   | integer
 user_id              | integer
 vehicle_model_id     | integer
 package_id           | integer
 travel_type_id       | integer
 from_area_id         | integer
 to_area_id           | integer
 from_city_id         | integer
 to_city_id           | integer
 from_date            | date
 to_date              | date
 online_booking       | boolean
 mobile_site_booking1 | boolean
 booking_created      | date
 from_lat             | numeric
 from_long            | numeric
 to_lat               | numeric
 to_long              | numeric
 car_cancellation     | boolean
